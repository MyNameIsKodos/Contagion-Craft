# ContagionCraft!

## What is it?

ContagionCraft is a mod that introduces the wonderful world of Virology to
to players in a very simplified format.  This mod is inspired heavily by
the Virology system in a game known as Space Station 13

## The Equipment

### Isolation Centrifuge

This machine runs on RF (maybe other power?) and will be used to isolate various things from within various substances (contagions/antibodies within blood), and outputs items needed for the mod

### Radium Dispenser

A block (Possibly with a model) that you place on the wall, and can be right clicked with a Syringe which fills the syringe with a single (maybe 3) dose of Radium (Yes, Radium is a real thing used in Nuclear Medicine), or an empty hand to get a beaker of radium, for use in finding cures.


## Items

### Empty Syringe

Made with (Recipe TBA), an empty syringe can be used with a Beaker of Radium in a crafting grid to 'fill' it with Radium for use in triggering antibody production in a mob. It can also be right clicked on a mob to get a blood sample from that mob

### Beaker of Radium

Acquired by rightclicking a Radium Dispenser with an empty hand, a Beaker of Radium is just a crafting component used to make Radium Syringes

### Antibodies (###)

Acquired via centrifuging the blood of a mob that has been infected with a contagion, as well as dosed with Radium, it is used to cure diseases.  The numerical suffix is the identification of antibodies, as different diseases need different antibodies to be cured.

### Bio Suit (Four pieces)

Wear this to protect yourself from receiving any contagions, viruses, or diseases. Will probably have some sort of negative effect to discourage wearing it all the time.

## The Plague! Just (mostly) kidding!

So, you (Or another player, or mob) got a virus! Well, what are you going
to do about it?  I'll tell you!

### Step 1: Protect yourself!

You'll want to equip a Bio Suit, available in all four types of gear (Boots,
legs, chest, and head) to ensure you don't catch whatever it is that someone
has!

### Step 2: Quarantine

Diseases and Viruses will have a transmit range of 2 blocks, so the first
thing you'll want to do is quarantine the affected player or mob in a cell built
with walls in a 7x7 cube shape to ensure that they don't get within range of
another player or mob that isn't already affected by the contagion.  You can use any blocks for the cell, so make it look as nice or nasty as you want!

### Step 3: Research!

You didn't think curing this stuff would be easy, did you?

You'll want to take a blood sample from the affected entity. Contagions don't
damage mobs or players, but they are deadly if not cured before the effect timer runs out.

Once you have the blood sample, you'll want to isolate the contagion within the blood using an Isolation Centrifuge (Details above). Once you've done that you'll be able to inject the isolated pathogen, as well as some Radium (acquired from a Radium Dispenser, details above) into another quarantined mob (Test subjects, anyone?) and wait for the mob to develop Antibodies (Described above).

### Step 4: Clean (Blood) Sweep!

Once antibody creation occurs (Usually in 1-2 minutes after radium injection), you'll draw a sample of the second mob's blood and use _that_ blood in the Isolation Centrifuge to isolate the Antibodies needed to cure that particular virus. Once isolated, you will be able to dilute them into water and create vaccines as needed
